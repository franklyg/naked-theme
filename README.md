# Simple Theme
It's as simple as it sounds. A Shopify theme that is completely barebones. Just static sections built with Tailwind CSS.

## Liquid Template Rules
The following is a template for how all files should start.
```
{%- comment -%}[NAME OF SECTION, SNIPPET, TEMLATE] SECTION{%- endcomment -%}

<[div, section, article, ...]  class=" [name of - section, snippet, template, ...] [tailwind classes]">
    ... All the fun 
</[div, section, article, ...]>
```
